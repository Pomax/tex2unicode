This is a repo set up so that I have a stable place for the script that is offered for download over on https://enteropia.wordpress.com/2012/06/09/ascii-art-math, itself based on http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=blob;f=misc/tex2mail.in;h=316f00e01a0241262251710ecb3928859587fab3;hb=HEAD

Should they decide to set up their own repo for this script, this repo will get deleted as unnecessary.
